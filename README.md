# landing-page
Second project from The Odin Project, part of the CSS section of the curriculum.

Ultimately this assignment is to demonstrate capability in using basic CSS skills like:

-Flexbox\
-Removing default styling from HTML elements and substituting unique styling\
-Flexible (not really responsive) design for browser window resizing\
-Making a website that doesn't look like it's made only using HTML :)

May add additional JS functionality later, or use this as a basis for future projects.
